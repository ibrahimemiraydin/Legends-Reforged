<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Legends Reforged: Adventure , Technology and Exploration!</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Legends Reforged</strong> brings a level and a huge skill tree system to minecraft with the <strong>Mine and Slash</strong>. Just like in Path of Exile. For world generation I used <strong>Terralith </strong>and <strong>Biomes of plenty</strong>. In this way we made the simple world of Minecraft larger with new biomes and environments. Of course, there are lots of <strong>Dungeons and Structures</strong> to make the world more explorable. You can also <strong>level up</strong> faster by doing quests in these dungeons. Alongside making exploration in dungeons, you can also find a hobby for yourself with mods such as <strong>Create and Mekanism</strong>, which are technology mods that everyone loves.<br><br>This is not all. You can&nbsp; discover many things not mentioned here by playing this modpack.</p>
